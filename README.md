### Synopsis ###

It is a web application containing both client-side and server-side projects. The client-side is made using Bootstrap Framework and Angular JS along with Jquery.
The server-side is REST API made using Java and Spring Framework. 
This project uses MongoDB as database and JSON Object to communicate with each other.

The main motive of this project is to implement CRUD operations on database through web application.

### How do I get set up? ###

After cloning the repository, you need to set up some things. The Tomcat Server and MongoDB Instance.You will also need Maven to make the build.

You need to go to the directory in server-side where pom.xml is present. Open cmd and go to the pom.xml directory. Then type the following command
 
```
mvn clean install


```
You will see the directory in which Maven will keep the .war file. Now copy that file iin the webapps directory of tomcat7.

Place both client-side-ui and .war file in the webapps directory. Start the tomcat server. After this you can check if clint-side-ui is working or not by going to the browser and hitting http://localhost:8080/client-side-ui/index.html

But it won't be showing the data. For this you need to run the MongodB first because to run our application we first need to set up MongoDB and then need to restart the server.

In this project I am including the database also. After setting up the MongoDB on your system, you need to restore the project database on your localhost. You might need to search for steps to restore your Mongo database with the name 'vatan'. After restoring the database, first restart MongoDB and then restart the tomcat-server.

By default the server-side api is pointing to local database with the name 'vatan'. You can change this by going to the application.properties and change the database name. Or you can also change the machine IP also if your database is running on another machince.

You can also change the IP where your REST Api is running. For that you need to change mainUrl in app.js of client-side/scripts.
